Folder Structure:
All folders structure follow OTP strictly. Or you will have a bad time making a release package (even though you can clean compile every time). This is for the full benefit of
OTP hot code upgrade ....

More details below.

Compiling (brief notes)
We are using Basho Tech Rebar tool.
under  project root dir:
make 

or (keeping dependencies)
./rebar clean 
export VERSION=<your version number>
./rebar compile

or (cleaning dependencies and clean compile)
./rebar del-deps
./rebar get-deps
export VERSION=<your version number>
./rebar compile

Making package.
Get rid of the rel/glitter folder
on project root folder
export VERSION=<your version number>
./rebar -v -f generate
Then test it out (at least that it loads)
./relglitterl/bin/glitter console
then
application:which_applications().
You should see a display showing glitter as  the app name, the versoon
and the depedency app and their versions.

BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT our folder nameing, your registered app and app naming...

I spent 1 day to fix up and am still learning..
